<ul><h5>Overview</h5></ul>
 <p>One of the more prominent issues with HMDs (head mounted displays) like the HTC VIVE and Oculus Rift is the limited
   amount of room the user has to move around. Many developers have found interesting ways around this problem, where for most we have
  covered in class (teleportation, flying around with the wands). while other developers might limit the size of their game by limiting how
  much room the player has, the idea of 360 degree treadmills may make this an issue of the past.

  <ul><h5>Technology</h5></ul>
  <p>
    The idea behind these treadmills is that the user is held ( usally at the waist / chest ) to insure they don't fall over, while the treadmill has little friction to enable
    the user to walk/run in any direction. Both the treadmills being covered here use specialized shoes that are essential to make the ovrerall treadmill work.
    Where the shoes help keep the treadmills have less friction, to better support running. The treadmills simulate the movments, where Vue VR even supports jumping, and the
    rest of the movments are either handeled by the controllers that came with the HMDs or with a custom controller (like the rifle in the picture above).
  </p>
  <ul><h5>Thoughts</h5></ul>
  <p>
    These types of systems have great potential, even if in their current state they might be expensive or hard to get. They are a great addition to a VR setup in a room with limited space. This would give people
    the ability to do more than just pretend to walk/run in games, but to actually do it in real life. As these technologies mature and become cheaper, they may become the best accesory to have after
    buying an HMD.
