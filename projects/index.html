           This project was made for our Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality course at the University of Illinois at Chicago by Bartosz Kupiec and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitar-kirilov-542173142/">Dimitar Kirilov</a>. For this project, we were instructed to remake our classrooms at EVL into a room that would be our ideal office area. Our approach was to make a room that made us feel comfortable and at ease when working.
In order to achieve both those goals, we decided to divide our office space into two main areas - a work area and a lounging area. For our work area, we added our desk necessities along with some decorations to and around our desks to make it feel more homely. We also decided to add a small kitchen area near our desks for quick fresheners during work. For our lounging area, we decided to add a home entertainment system which included a TV, speakers, and PlayStation 4 for our virtual entertainment. We also included a basketball hoop to shoot some baskets from time to time and a skeeball machine to pass time when we were tired of watching television or playing games during our break time.
In order to make the whole office space more realistic and interactive, we tried to add physics to as many objects as we could. Our general decision making for whether we could make something be intractable was if we could pick it up in real life by ourselves, we should add physics to it and be able to throw it around. Everything that we gave physics to could be picked up, thrown around, or knocked off its location with enough force.

          Stella is an interactive app that gives its user the information and fun facts about the planets/moons in our solar system.
          The primary demographic of this app are students that are currently learning about the solar system, so they can easily
          check up on the facts by using their phone. One goal of the project was to make a real time representation of the planets
          locations, but due to time constraints and learning curve of making this possible, it was simplified down to a semi-accurate animation of planets on the main screen.
